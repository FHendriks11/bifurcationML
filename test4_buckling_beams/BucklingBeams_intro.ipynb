    "# Buckling Beams Problem: Introduction"

    "**Summary**: we consider a beam that is attached to a base on the bottom, and then prescribe a displacement to the top of the beam. For a small displacement, the beam will compress but not bend. However, when the displacement reaches a critical value, the system becomes unstable and the beam will buckle, which will make it bend to either the left side or right side; either option is equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the system**: The beam consists of $n$ compressible beam elements, of which element $i$ has length $L_i$ and is compressible with a stiffness $C_i$. There are torsion springs between the base and the first element and between subsequent elements; these torsion springs have spring constant $K_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](beamdiagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the beam deforms, the amount element $i$ is compressed is described by the strain $\\epsilon_i$. We use Hencky strains, which are defined as $\\epsilon_i = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_i'}{L}\\right)$, where $L_i$ is the reference length of the beam element and $L_i'$ the length of the deformed beam element.\n",
    "The angle the elements make with the vertical are $q_i$. In the undeformed reference configuration the beam is oriented straight up, and therefore these angles are initially all zero.\n",
    "The displacement prescribed to the top of the beam in downward direction is $d$. It takes a certain unknown force $P$ to apply this displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "* Input: displacement $d$ (applied in increments)\n",
    "* Parameters: lengths $L_i$, spring constants $K_i$, stiffnesses $C_i$.\n",
    "* Output: angles $q_i$, strains $\\epsilon_i$, optionally force $P$. This output can also be described by the final positions of nodes location at the top and bottom of the beam as well as the joints between elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strain energy is defined as:\n",
    "$$U(\\mathbf{q}, \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[K_1q_1^2 + \\sum_{i=2}^n K_i(q_i-q_{i-1})^2\\right] + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n L_iC_i \\epsilon_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The applied displacement $d$ to the top of the beam is related to the angles $q_i$ and strains $\\epsilon_i$ as follows:\n",
    "$$d = \\sum_{i=1}^n L_i \\left[1-\\exp(\\epsilon_i)\\cos q_i\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In BucklingBeams_createDataset.ipynb, we solve this problem by finding the values of $q_i$ and $\\epsilon_i$ that minimize the strain energy, while still respecting the constraint from $d$. We do this using a Lagrange multiplier.\n",
    "We create a dataset by sampling various values of $n$, $K_i$, $C_i$ and $L_i$.\n",
    "Because the displacement $d$ is applied in increments, this results in trajectories of the beam deforming, where in the final time step $d = \\sum_i L_i$, such that the tip of the beam is bent all the way to the base. We created 999 such trajectories.\n",
